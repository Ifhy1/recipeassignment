        <h2>Tips</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        For extra depth of flavor, <strong>add a splash of red wine</strong> when adding the tomatoes.  
        You can also sprinkle freshly grated Parmesan on top before serving for a rich finish.  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cook the sauce a day ahead — it tastes even better after the flavors have developed overnight.</li>
        <li>Reserve a cup of pasta cooking water to mix into the sauce for a silkier texture.</li>
        <li>Use fresh herbs like basil or parsley just before serving for a burst of freshness.</li>
    </ul>
